**Precision at the core: total tolerance stack‚Äëup, intelligently fused.**

StackCore is a lightweight Python package for mechanical **tolerance stack‚Äëup analysis**, integrating Monte Carlo simulation and data‚Äëdriven intelligence.

---

## üöÄ Features

- üßÆ **Tolerance stack‚Äëup under control**: manage multi‚Äëcomponent linear and geometric assemblies.
- üîÅ **Monte Carlo engine**: generate distributions, confidence ranges, and worst‚Äëcase scenarios.
- üìä **Flexible output**: summary stats, histograms, and data visualization tools.
- üîå **Clean APIs**: `Stack`, `PStack`, `MStack`
- üõ†Ô∏è **Designed for engineers**: zone‚Äëindependent, boundary‚Äëaware, CAD/tool‚Äëagnostic.

---

## üì• Installation

```bash
pip install stackcore
```

## Usage
To import the ```stackcore``` module, use
```python
import stackcore
```

The main component, the ```Stack``` can be imported as follows:
```python
from stackcore import Stack
```

The ```Stack``` Component taks a few key arguments:
### Main Plane
The main plane is defined by a set of 3 points, and defines the main plane that the tolerance stack up will measure against. Here's an example:
```python
m=np.array([[3,  2, -1],
            [0,  3,  3],
            [-1, 2,  4]])
```
### Components
The components variable contains a dictioary of planes and their respective tolerances, with many various tolerance types such as displacement and radial (axis).
Here's an example:
```python
components = [
             {'plane': np.array([[-8, 1, 5],
                                 [-4, 7, 3],
                                 [-3, 2, 6]]),
              'tolerances': [{'type': 'cylindrical',
                              'tol': [-0.1, +0.1],
                              'axis': np.array([[0,0,1], 
                                                [0,0,1],
                                                [-.7, -0.9, 0.]])},
                              {'type': 'displacement',
                               'tol' : [-0.1, +0.1],
                               'axis': np.array([[0,0,1], 
                                                 [0,0,1],
                                                 [-.7, -0.9, 0.]])}]}
]
```
### Metrics
The metrics variable contains a dictionary of the targeted metrics and their reference type. The 2 tolerance types currently supported are ```'Angular'``` and ```'Linear'``` Here's an example:
```python
metrics = [
    { 'name': 'alpha',
      'type': 'Angular'
    }
]
```
### Path
The path variable defines where any generated figures should be stored. Here's an example:
```python
path = 'path/to/figures/'
```

### Parallel Processing
For faster processing, the ```PStack``` object is provided that uses the ```numba``` package to parallelize the loops in the monte carlo simulation. To use the ```PStack```, import it using:
```python
from stackcore import PStack
```
All of the same functions of the ```Stack``` object are available in the ```PStack``` object.


## Metrology
(v0.3.0) StackCore now supports component compatibility testing via metrology data. 
To access this, use the ```MStack``` object, which takes the same inputs as the serial and parallel stacks above. To use the ```MStack``` object:

```python
from stackcore import Mstack
```

For metrology, the ```component``` input looks a little different. Each component is defined by **3 points**, and each point has its own metrology (‚àÇx, ‚àÇy, ‚àÇz) associated with it. Here's an example:

```python
[
        {
            "name": "Component",
            "points": [
                {
                    "coordinates": [
                        -20,
                        10,
                        6
                    ],
                    "dx": 1.0,
                    "dy": -1.0,
                    "dz": 0.0
                },
                {
                    "coordinates": [
                        -15,
                        12,
                        5
                    ],
                    "dx": 0.0,
                    "dy": 0.2,
                    "dz": 0.3
                },
                {
                    "coordinates": [
                        -3,
                        5,
                        6
                    ],
                    "dx": -1.0,
                    "dy": 0.01,
                    "dz": -0.4
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
```
